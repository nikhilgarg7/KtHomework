# KtHomework

This is a set of offline problems loosely based off the [Gentle Kotlin](https://kotlin.cs.illinois.edu) course. 

The `src/` folder has packages sorted by each lesson on the website. For each file read the comments given and get your score to full following the instructions on what to change and what not to change.

This isn't graded and combination of problems by various people, feel free to add your own via pull request :)

For the sake of simplicity there is a hacky test framework and no gradle dependency and install setup. Just each file stands on it's own.

Inspired by [Kotlin Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html) and [Ruby Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/)
